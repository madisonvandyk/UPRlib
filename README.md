Test instances for universal packet routing

There are two sets of instances: geographic and geometric

We have the following parameters:
n - number of nodes
m - number of arcs
k - number of commodities
alpha_1, alpha_2 - lower and upper bounds for arc capacities
beta_1, beta_2 - lower and upper bounds for node storage capacities
p - local parameter for Geometric instances
q - global parameter for geometric instances

Geographic:
Files are labelled as 'Geographic' + n,k,m,[alpha_1, alpha_2],[beta_1,beta_2]

Geometric:
Files arc labelled as 'Geometric' + k,p,q,[alpha_1, alpha_2],[beta_1,beta_2]
